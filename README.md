# J.A.T.E. - Just Another Text Editor

## Description

With this web text editor a user can create notes or code snippets regardless of whether they have an internet connection. The notes are then saved where the user can retrieve them for later use. The integrated service worker and Cache API's are what make sure the application will remain fully functional even without internet connection. Because of this, the user can access visited pages even if the application is offline.
